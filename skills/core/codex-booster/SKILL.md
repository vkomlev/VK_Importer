# Codex Booster

## Workflow
1. Choose mode:
- `use`
- `configure`
- `rollout`
- `audit`
- `optimize`
- `import-claude`
2. Determine the source case:
- default source is the current chat if the user did not name another case;
- extract the concrete incident, affected artifact, and expected behavior.
3. Load fleet context from [references/fleet-map.md](references/fleet-map.md), routing context from [references/skill-catalog.md](references/skill-catalog.md), and shared booster invariants from [references/booster-shared.md](references/booster-shared.md).
4. Before editing any skill, classify ownership and runtime:
- canonical source-of-truth;
- required mirrors/runtime copies;
- runtime class: `codex-runtime`, `project-runtime`, or `external-runtime`.
5. Run the mandatory improvement loop:
- log the incident in the error register;
- run `5 Whys`;
- patch the responsible Codex skill directly;
- if the culprit is a Cursor agent, hand off the preventive fix to `cursor-booster`.
6. When improving any skill or agent, run an anti-bloat refactor pass before closing:
- collapse repeated incident-specific rules into the smallest reusable invariant set;
- move detailed checks to existing references/checklists when possible instead of growing `SKILL.md`;
- remove or merge wording that duplicates already-covered guardrails.
7. Run packaging and placement checks when skill files are touched:
- YAML/frontmatter parse;
- `quick_validate.py`;
- `agents/openai.yaml` consistency if UI visibility matters;
- correct runtime placement in `~/.codex/skills` when Codex visibility is required.
8. When Codex/Claude "disappear" in Cursor, check runtime before blaming install or skills:
- verify the extensions are installed and activate from Cursor logs;
- inspect workspace-local `state.vscdb` under `%APPDATA%/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/*` for hidden view/container state such as `workbench.view.extension.codexViewContainer.state` and `workbench.view.extension.claude-sidebar.state`;
- inspect `renderer.log` for extension/container compatibility signals such as missing API proposals or messages that `codexSecondaryViewContainer` / `claude-sidebar-secondary` do not exist;
- if the logs show secondary-sidebar containers are missing, treat it as Cursor/extension compatibility drift and prefer a backed-up manifest workaround instead of changing project skills;
- treat missing buttons as a workspace UI-state incident first if extensions are present;
- back up the affected `state.vscdb` before any repair and prefer a deterministic script such as `scripts/repair-cursor-ai-views.py`.
9. When Codex in Cursor fails on send/create-task with `no-client-found` on Windows:
- inspect `Codex.log` for `local-environments is not supported in the extension`, `client-status-changed`, and `Initialize received`;
- run `wsl.exe --status` and `wsl.exe --list --verbose`;
- if `wsl.exe` exists but no distro is installed, treat it as missing local execution environment rather than a project/skill failure;
- prefer fixing WSL/local environment readiness before changing skills, prompts, or project files.
10. Run mandatory encoding discipline for non-ASCII skill/docs work, especially on Windows/PowerShell:
- force explicit UTF-8 in shell-driven read/write/validation paths;
- when using Python from CLI, set `PYTHONUTF8=1`;
- do not trust terminal rendering alone for Cyrillic or other non-ASCII text;
- if output shows mojibake or replacement characters, verify the file bytes directly before deciding whether the file is actually broken.
11. Run post-edit parity and validation:
- canonical source matches intended mirrors;
- `~/.codex/skills/**/SKILL.md` parses cleanly;
- impacted project-local copies parse cleanly with runtime-appropriate checks;
- tolerate UTF-8 BOM during validation instead of reporting false frontmatter failures.
12. For non-ASCII files touched through CLI or rollout, run a byte-level encoding check:
- confirm UTF-8 bytes survived the operation;
- compare canonical vs mirror copies by hash/bytes, not only terminal text;
- fail the task if replacement `?` characters were introduced where the canonical source contains Cyrillic text.
13. Enforce strict UTF-8 as the default storage format for skill, rule, prompt, markdown, and similar text artifacts:
- prefer UTF-8 without BOM unless a runtime explicitly requires BOM;
- do not keep `cp1251` or other legacy encodings as a convenience workaround;
- if a legacy encoded file is touched, normalize it to UTF-8 unless a documented runtime constraint forbids that conversion.
14. In `optimize` mode:
- load the current skill/agent instructions;
- identify duplicated, overly specific, or incident-bound wording;
- compress them into the smallest reusable invariant set that preserves behavior;
- prefer shorter `SKILL.md` plus stronger references/checklists over instruction sprawl.
15. In `import-claude` mode:
- use [references/claude-import-checklist.md](references/claude-import-checklist.md);
- compare live Claude coverage from `C:/Users/user/.claude` against source and Codex runtime before editing;
- import platform-neutral invariants and adapt platform-specific mechanics through [references/codex-project-binding.md](references/codex-project-binding.md);
- update source-of-truth first, then package runtime and project mirrors.
16. For rollout, use [references/rollout-ops.md](references/rollout-ops.md) and do dry-run first.
17. Finish with deterministic commands, expected artifacts, and verification.

## Quality Rules
- Never close an improvement task without: register entry, `5 Whys`, culprit patch, and verification.
- Never patch only one copy when the same skill has required mirrors.
- Never apply Codex packaging assumptions to project/external runtimes without evidence or explicit user request.
- Treat fleet updates as incomplete until affected project mirrors were checked or synchronized.
- Prefer compact, reusable guardrails over incident-specific rule accretion.
- Treat skill/agent improvement as incomplete if repeated rules were not normalized and unnecessary instruction growth was left in place.
- Treat any CLI-driven non-ASCII file update as incomplete until encoding was validated by explicit UTF-8 and byte-level parity checks.
- Treat "missing Codex/Claude buttons" as unresolved until extension activation and workspace `state.vscdb` view visibility were both checked.
- Treat UTF-8 as the required steady-state encoding for touched text artifacts unless a documented runtime constraint says otherwise.
- In `optimize` mode, prefer behavioral equivalence with fewer instructions over verbatim preservation of duplicated wording.
- In `import-claude` mode, import invariants and verified workflow patterns; do not copy Claude-only permissions, command syntax, hooks, or runtime assumptions without a Codex mapping.
